# intro
Users can and are encouraged to build their own custom analytic capability, what we call a 'Task', to use within the Workflow system on GBDX.  

# what you will learn
This tutorial will walk you through the multi-step process of registering a Task to GBDX, starting with sample code that clips a raster to a shapefile as our example Task. 

The tutorial describes the files required to register a Task. If you execute the provided code within the notebook, on a cell by cell basis in top-down order, those files will be written to your computer for you. You can also create those files yourself outside of the notebook if you prefer. 

# to get started
__GBDX Notebooks__
Become familiar with Tasks and Workflows through tutorials in the [GBDX Notebooks module](../gbdx_notebooks_module/README.md)

__Install Anaconda and gbdxtools__
Instructions are provided in the [gbdxtools module](../gbdxtools_module/README.md)

__Install Docker__
1. Install Docker from https://www.docker.com/
2. Test your Docker installation by starting Docker and pasting in the following command, which should return your Docker version 
```
docker version
```
3. Sign up for a free Docker Hub account at https://hub.docker.com/

__Download and start the Notebook tutorial:__
1. Download the file [custom-task-tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/GeoBigData/gbdx-training/blob/master/custom_task_module/custom-task-tutorial.ipynb) from this repository.

2. Open a terminal/cmd window and copy and paste `jupyter notebook`. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser [(documentation here)](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running). 

3. You can navigate your file system and open the downloaded custom-task-tutorial.ipynb notebook from the Jupyter Notebook interface. 

4. The custom-task-tutorial.ipynb explains all of the steps required to register a custom task to GBDX, along with example code. You can execute the code within the notebook by using the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + ENTER, or select the play button in the toolbar. Follow the instructions in the notebook and optionally watch the [recording of this tutorial](https://digitalglobe.wistia.com/medias/8z9hj4g960).
