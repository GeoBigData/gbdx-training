# intro 
AnswerFactory is a GBDX-powered web app that allows users to extract information about imagery in an easy-to-use interface. Create projects by selecting an area of interest, then add 'answers' to do things like locate and count ojects, detect change, and extract features. You can view the output of your analysis within the web app, or download the output and view it in a GIS.
